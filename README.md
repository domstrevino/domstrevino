- 👋 Hi, I’m @domstrevino.
- 👀 I’m a senior student majoring in CIS-Programming.
- 🌱 At this time I am working to give two of my former projects that I no longer have access to a complete refactor with different frameworks.
- 💞️ I mainly use C#, MS SQL Server, and Javascript.

-After my completion of my current two projects, I will be rewriting them with Java to freshen up on my capabilities regarding the language.
